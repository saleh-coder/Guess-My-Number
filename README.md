# Guess My Number

Welcome to the "Guess My Number" game! This project is a simple number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective is to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20.

## Features

Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number between 1 and 20 that the player needs to guess.
Feedback Messages: Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Score Tracking: Tracks the player's score, which decreases with each incorrect guess.
Game Over Condition: The game ends when the score reaches zero, and the player is notified.

## How to Play

1. Start the Game: Reload the page to generate a new random number.
2. Make a Guess: Enter a number between 1 and 20 and submit.
3. Receive Feedback: The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. Try Again: Adjust your guess based on the feedback until you either guess correctly or run out of attempts.
